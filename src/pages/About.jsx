              <h1>Our Founding Story</h1>
              <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-300 lg:w-[95%]">
                Our e-learning platform was born out of a shared vision and
                passion for transforming education. It all began with a group of
                educators, technologists, and lifelong learners who recognized
                the need for accessible, flexible, and high-quality learning
                opportunities in a rapidly evolving digital world.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-300 lg:w-[95%]">
                As experienced educators ourselves, we witnessed firsthand the
                limitations and challenges of traditional education systems. We
                believed that education should not be confined to the walls of a
                classroom or restricted by geographical boundaries. We
                envisioned a platform that could bridge these gaps and empower
                individuals from all walks of life to unlock their full
                potential.

              <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-300 lg:w-[95%]">
                With this vision in mind, we set out on a journey to create an
                e-learning platform that would revolutionize the way people
                learn. Our team of dedicated experts worked tirelessly to
                develop a robust and intuitive platform that combines
                cutting-edge technology with engaging content, fostering a
                dynamic and interactive learning experience.

                Our mission goes beyond just delivering courses online. We
                wanted to create a vibrant community of learners, where
                individuals can connect, collaborate, and learn from one
                another. We believe that knowledge thrives in an environment of
                sharing and dialogue, and we foster this spirit of collaboration
                through forums, live sessions, and networking opportunities.
